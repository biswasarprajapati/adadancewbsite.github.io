                 p Perfect is the horizon that vanishes as you approach it. And yet, dancers continue to chase unrealistic idealsâ€”research has shown considerably high levels of perfectionism in dancers. While dancers need to be disciplined in their practice to be successful, perfectionism left unchecked can have serious consequences.

                 p It has health benefits from increasing stamina, relieving stress, and body sculpting to name a few. But it's also great for mental and emotional health.

                 p Freedom and flexibility: For the most part, dance instructors get to set our own schedules, which allows us to earn money by teaching people about our passion, while also pursuing creative projects on the side. There are few things more liberating and exciting than working as a full-time dance instructor.
